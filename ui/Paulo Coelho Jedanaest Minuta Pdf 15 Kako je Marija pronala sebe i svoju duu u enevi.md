Maria's journey begins when she falls in love for the first time at the age of eleven, with a boy who asks her for a pencil. She dreams of finding her prince charming and living happily ever after, but her life takes a different turn when she meets a Swiss man who offers her a chance to work in Europe. She accepts, hoping to find adventure and fortune, but soon realizes that she has been deceived and sold into prostitution.
 
Maria's life becomes a cycle of sex, money and loneliness, until she meets Ralf, a handsome and successful painter who awakens her passion and desire. They embark on a sensual and spiritual relationship that challenges Maria's views on love, sex and herself. She discovers that there is more to sex than just physical pleasure, and that it can be a path to self-knowledge and enlightenment.
 
*Eleven Minutes* is a novel that explores the complex and mysterious nature of human sexuality, as well as the power of love to transform and heal. It is also a reflection on the role of women in society, their freedom and dignity. Coelho writes with honesty and sensitivity, creating a memorable and inspiring heroine who faces her fears and follows her heart.

Coelho uses various symbols and metaphors to illustrate his points, such as the pencil that Maria lends to her first love, the fairy tale that she reads to a child, the eleven minutes that represent the average duration of a sexual encounter, and the dark night of the soul that she experiences before finding her true self. He also draws inspiration from various religious and philosophical traditions, such as Christianity, Islam, Tantra and alchemy.
 
Some of the quotes from the book that capture its essence are:
 
- "Everything tells me that I am about to make a wrong decision, but making mistakes is just part of life. What does the world want of me? Does it want me to take no risks, to go back to where I came from because I didn't have the courage to say 'yes' to life?"[^1^]
- "Now that she had nothing to lose, she was free."[^1^]
- "Passion makes a person stop eating, sleeping, working, feeling at peace. A lot of people are frightened because, when it appears, it demolishes all the old things it finds in its path."[^1^]
- "In love, no one can harm anyone else; we are each of us responsible for our own feelings and cannot blame someone else for what we feel."[^1^]
- "You can either be a victim of the world or an adventurer in search of treasure. It's all a question of how I view my life."[^1^]
- "No one loses anyone, because no one owns anyone. That is the true experience of freedom: having the most important thing in the world without owning it."[^1^]
- "Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they're not. When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the next, or â such is the pleasure they experience â they may never finish it. No eleven minutes for them."[^1^]
- "Dreaming is very pleasant as long as you are not forced to put your dreams into practice."[^1^]
- "Life always waits for some crisis to occur before revealing itself at its most brilliant."[^1^]
- "Anyone who has lost something they thought was theirs forever finally comes to realise that nothing really belongs to them."[^2^]
