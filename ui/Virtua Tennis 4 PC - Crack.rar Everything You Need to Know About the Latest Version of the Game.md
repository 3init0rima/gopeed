Virtua Tennis 4 is the latest installment in the popular tennis game series by SEGA. It features many of the top players in the world, such as Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, and Maria Sharapova, as well as a variety of modes and mini-games to play. However, despite some graphical improvements and new features, Virtua Tennis 4 fails to impress with its dated and simplistic gameplay, flawed career mode, limited online options, and terrible motion controls.

The core gameplay of Virtua Tennis 4 is essentially the same as it was in the original arcade game from 1999. You have three main shot types: top spin, lob, and slice, which you can direct with the left analog stick. The game also relies heavily on your position on the court and around the ball to determine the power and accuracy of your shots. This makes the game easy to pick up, but also very shallow and repetitive. There is little room for advanced tactics or risk-taking, as most shots are guaranteed to land in play as long as you make contact with the ball. The only new addition to the gameplay is the super shot feature, which lets you unleash a slow-motion hit with a cinematic camera angle once your meter is full. However, this feature is more annoying than useful, as it disrupts the flow of the game and doesn't offer any significant advantage over a normal power shot.
 
The career mode of Virtua Tennis 4 is also a letdown. Instead of a realistic simulation of a tennis career, you have to play a bizarre board game where you move around by spinning a wheel. You can encounter different events on the board, such as tournaments, mini-games, charity events, or injuries. While this adds some randomness and variety to the mode, it also makes it frustrating when you can't play what you want or when you want because of the luck of the spin. The mini-games are fun distractions at first, but they get old quickly and don't really improve your skills or stats. The mode also lacks any sense of progression or challenge, as you can easily win most matches without much effort.
 
The online mode of Virtua Tennis 4 is also very limited. You can play matches against other players and earn points for your ranking, but that's about it. There is no online career or tournament mode, no leaderboards or statistics, no chat or communication options, and no way to customize your matches or rules. The online mode feels like an afterthought and doesn't offer much incentive to keep playing.
 
Finally, Virtua Tennis 4 also supports motion controls for all three platforms: Kinect for Xbox 360, PlayStation Move for PS3, and Wii Motion Plus for Wii. However, none of these work well and make the game even worse. The motion controls are inaccurate and unresponsive, making it hard to hit the ball where you want or even at all. The game also forces you to stand in a fixed position on the court and doesn't let you move around freely. The motion controls are a gimmick that doesn't add anything to the game and should be avoided at all costs.
 
Virtua Tennis 4 is a disappointing tennis game that doesn't live up to its predecessors or its competitors. It has outdated and simplistic gameplay, a flawed career mode, limited online options, and terrible motion controls. It might appeal to casual players who just want a quick match or some wacky mini-games, but anyone looking for a deeper and more realistic tennis experience should look elsewhere.
