## Battle of Youstrass: Tips and Tricks for Beginners
 
If you are new to Battle of Youstrass, you might find the game challenging and complex at first. But don't worry, we are here to help you with some tips and tricks that will make your gameplay easier and more enjoyable. Here are some of the things you should know before you start your adventure in the world of Youstrass.
 
- **Save often.** The game does not have an auto-save feature, so you have to manually save your progress at any time. You can save up to 10 files, and you can also quick save by pressing F5. It is recommended to save before and after every battle, as well as before making important decisions that affect the story.
- **Use T-Engines and T-Tools wisely.** T-Engines are devices that allow you to customize your units' equipment, skills and stats. You can access them from the main menu or from the shop. T-Tools are items that can be used on the battlefield to perform various actions, such as healing, repairing or hacking. You can buy them from the shop or find them in chests. Both T-Engines and T-Tools are limited in quantity, so use them sparingly and strategically.
- **Pay attention to the terrain and weather.** The terrain and weather affect your units' movement, accuracy and damage. For example, high mountains give you an advantage in height and defense, but reduce your movement speed. Rain reduces your accuracy and fire damage, but increases your water damage. You can check the terrain and weather information by pressing F1.
- **Use combo attacks.** Some units have skills that can be combined with other units' skills to create powerful combo attacks. For example, Ryuke and Tia can use their fire skills together to create a firestorm. To use a combo attack, you have to position your units next to each other and select the appropriate skills. You can check the possible combos by pressing F2.
- **Explore different paths.** The game has a branching storyline with multiple endings depending on your choices and actions. Some paths will lead you to different locations, battles and characters. You can also unlock hidden episodes by fulfilling certain conditions. For example, if you want to recruit Miri, you have to defeat her in episode 7 without killing any of her allies. To see all the possible paths, you can refer to the episode tree in [^2^].
