## What is Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics?
  
Angular momentum is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics that describes the rotational motion of a system. It is defined as the cross product of the position vector and the linear momentum vector of a particle or a rigid body. The total angular momentum of an isolated system is conserved, meaning that it does not change over time.
  
In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is also a very important quantity that characterizes the state of a quantum system. However, unlike in classical mechanics, angular momentum is not a continuous variable but a discrete one. This means that it can only take certain values that are multiples of a fundamental unit called Planck's constant divided by 2Ï.
  
There are two types of angular momentum in quantum mechanics: orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum. Orbital angular momentum is associated with the motion of a particle around a fixed point or axis, such as an electron orbiting a nucleus. Spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of a particle that does not depend on its motion but on its quantum nature, such as an electron having two possible spin states: up or down.
  
The quantum theory of angular momentum deals with how to describe and manipulate these two types of angular momentum using mathematical tools such as operators, matrices, vectors, tensors, spherical harmonics, vector coupling coefficients, 3nj symbols, etc.
